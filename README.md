# Weemo-Bot
Discord bot made with the Java Discord API (JDA) for use in my own Discord server

It's basically a remake of my old Discord bot written in Java (which is sadly not on github :()

I'm trying here to abstract thing a lot so i can concentrate me on the fun stuff insteading of writing repeating code
